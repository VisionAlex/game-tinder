The scope of the project is to develop a game ranking platform unlike any other.

Storefront:

- build a logo for GameTinder (use a free logo generator) X
- the site should be responsive but mobile-first, header having the logo and a menu with following items: RankMe, Top 10. Should fit perfectly on mobile, with no vertical/horizontal scroll X
- RankMe - is a simple page showing the logo and menu and the image of a game (random selection from db). Slide left should mean you give it a thumbs-down, slide right it's thumbs-up, slide down is skip (you never played the game). The image of the game should be full screen on mobile with no scrollbars) with logo & menu on top of it
- Top 10 - shows the list of top 10 games
  Ranking algorithm: thumbs-down means -1, thumbs up +1, skip is 0.

We will not have a backend, so it's ok to fake backend API calls with hardcoded values.
